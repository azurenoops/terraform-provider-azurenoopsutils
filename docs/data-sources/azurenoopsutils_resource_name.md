# azurenoops_resource_name (Resource)

The data source azurenoops_resource_name generate a name for a resource (recommended way as data sources are evaluated before resources got created).

The azurenoops_resource_name resource allows you to:

* Clean inputs to make sure they remain compliant with the allowed patterns for each Azure resource
* Generate random characters to append at the end of the resource name
* Handle prefix, suffixes (either manual or as per the Azure cloud adoption framework resource conventions)
* Allow passthrough mode (simply validate the output)

## Exemple usage

This example shows how to get the value of an environment variable.

```hcl
data "azurenoops_resource_name" "rg_example" {
  name          = "demogroup"
  resource_type = "azurerm_resource_group"
  prefixes      = ["anoa", "${var.location}"]
  suffixes      = ["z"]
  random_length = 5
  clean_input   = true
}

output "rg_example" {
  value = data.azurenoops_resource_name.rg_example.result
}
```

```bash

data.azurenoops_resource_name.rg_example: Reading...
data.azurenoops_resource_name.rg_example: Read complete after 0s [id=anoa-eastus-demogroup-z-rg]

Changes to Outputs:
  + rg_example = "anoa-eastus-demogroup-z-rg"
```

## Combined with Azure resource

The data source evaluates the name before the resource got created and is visible at plan time.

```hcl
data "azurenoops_resource_name" "rg_example" {
  name          = "demogroup"
  resource_type = "azurerm_resource_group"
  prefixes      = ["anoa", "${var.location}"]
  suffixes      = ["z"]
  random_length = 5
  clean_input   = true
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = data.azurenoops_resource_name.rg_example.result
  location = "eastus"
}
```
```bash
data.azurenoops_resource_name.rg_example: Reading...
data.azurenoops_resource_name.rg_example: Read complete after 0s [id=anoa-eastus-demogroup-z-rg]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # azurerm_resource_group.rg will be created
  + resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + location = "eastus"
      + name     = "anoa-eastus-demogroup-z-rg"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```


## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* **name** - (optional) the basename of the resource to create, the basename will be sanitized as per supported characters set for each Azure resources.
* **prefixes** (optional) - a list of prefix to append as the first characters of the generated name - prefixes will be separated by the separator character
* **suffixes** (optional) -  a list of additional suffix added after the basename, this is can be used to append resource index (eg. vm-001). Suffixes are separated by the separator character
* **random_length** (optional) - default to ``0`` : configure additional characters to append to the generated resource name. Random characters will remain compliant with the set of allowed characters per resources and will be appended before suffix(ess).
* **random_seed** (optional) - default to ``0`` : Define the seed to be used for random generator. 0 will not be respected and will generate a seed based in the unix time of the generation.
* **resource_type** (optional) -  describes the type of azure resource you are requesting a name from (eg. azure container registry: azurerm_container_registry). See the Resource Type section
* **separator** (optional) - defaults to ``-``. The separator character to use between prefixes, resource type, name, suffixes, random character
* **clean_input** (optional) - defaults to ``true``. remove any noncompliant character from the name, suffix or prefix.
* **passthrough** (optional) - defaults to ``false``. Enables the passthrough mode - in that case only the clean input option is considered and the prefixes, suffixes, random, and are ignored. The resource prefixe is not added either to the resulting string
* **use_slug** (optional) - defaults to ``true``. If a slug should be added to the name - If you put false no slug (the few letters that identify the resource type) will be added to the name.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* **id** - The id of the naming convention object (same as the result value)
* **result** - The generated named for an Azure Resource based on the input parameter and the selected naming convention
